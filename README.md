# Karreidos

[Kaleidoscope](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) in Rust but somewhat modified.

Main differences from original Kaleidoscope:
- function definition with `fn` instead of `def`
- comment with `//` or `/* */`, not with `#`

## To be implemented
- [ ] Kaleidoscope itself.  
    current progress: chapter 3
- [ ] Language server protocol
- [ ] Port them using tree-sitter
